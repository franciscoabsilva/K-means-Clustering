## K-means-Clustering
Project for Introduction to Computer Architecture

# Introduction
This projects implements an algorithm that groups data points into a predefined number of clusters, denoted by k. It works by randomly initializing k centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and then recalculating the centroids based on the mean of the assigned points. This process repeats iteratively until the centroids no longer change significantly. The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster, making the points within a cluster as similar as possible.
